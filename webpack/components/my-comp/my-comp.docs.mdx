description: 'An example component using stylable css, to demonstrate the typescript and webpack overrides of my-org and my-team envs.'
---

This component utilises the webpack and typescript overrides of the `my-org` and `my-team` envs in this scope, to demonstrate the result of the
webpack and typescript overrides those envs implement.

The css of this component is implemented using stylable css, which would not work out of the box with standard CRA webpack or typescript config. By overriding the webpack 
and typescript configs with the required stylable configs, we have enabled stylable css for use in this `my-comp` component.

And as an added bonus, we've also added an svg icon just to show how svg works with bit out of the box - no extra config needed :)
